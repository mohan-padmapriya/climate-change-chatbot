  utter_faq/what:
  - text: "Veganism is a way of living which  excludes all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing, entertainment etc. It is a philosophy that aims to uplift the moral status of non-human sentient beings.\n\ Visit [The Vegan Society's page](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism#:~:text=%22Veganism%20is%20a%20philosophy%20and,benefit%20of%20animals%2C%20humans%20and) to understand the philosophy better."
  utter_faq/diff:
  - text: "Veganism and vegetarianism are different in several ways. Vegetarians might consume dairy, eggs, and honey, while vegans do not. It is often argued that being vegetarian is enough, since vegetarians do not contribute to the direct slaughter of animals in factory farms, for red meat. However, dairy cows are slaughtered after they are abused at dairy farms for years. The male calves that dairy cows give birth to are sent for slaughter right away, since they are of no economic value to the dairy farmer. Similar is the fate of male chicks in the egg industry. Once hens are barren, they are killed for their meat.\n\ To know more about why being vegetarian is not enough, do watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWna6-niYEg&feature=youtu.be)"
  utter_faq/why:
  - text: "People choose to vegan for three main reasons - for their health, for the environment, and for the animals. \n\ Did you know eat vegan is good for the environment? Do you know how going vegan affects your health. Ask me any questions you have, I'd be happy to answer them."
  utter_faq/how:
  - text: "If you would like to go vegan, here are some resources for you!\n\ It is important to remember to take it slow. Perhaps start by eating vegan once a week, and then one meal a day, and so on, until you get used to it. Maybe you can cut out red meat from your diet first, then fish, then dairy. Veganism is not about being perfect, we all make mistakes, so be easy on yourself. What matters most is that you're trying to make a change, which is great for the animals, the planet, and for you!"
  utter_faq/health:
  - text: "A balanced vegan diet consisting of a wide variety of fresh fruits, vegetables,\n\
      grains, legumes, nuts and seeds is the healthiest of all, with the bonus of\n\
      higher antioxidants and lower saturated fat and cholesterol. A well planned\n\
      vegan diet can also help with the prevention and treatment of many illnesses\n\
      and diseases such as; heart disease, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, kidney\n\
      stones and some cancers.\n\ Add position of WHO, ADA etc"
  utter_faq/protein:
  - text: "It is a myth that a vegan diet does not provide enough protein. Vegans get their protien from various sources, such as nuts, seeds, vegetables, legumes, etc. \n\ [Livekindly's article](https://www.livekindly.co/how-do-vegans-get-enough-protein-from-their-diet/) dispells this myth.\n\ If you're an athlete concerned about how the vegan diet will allow you to meet your daily protein requirements, check out [Forks over Knives' No-BS Guide to Vegan Protein](https://www.forksoverknives.com/wellness/vegan-protein-guide-athletes/) "

  utter_faq/animal_pain:
  - text: "Reseach has proved than animals do indeed feel pain. And they feel pain as intensly as humans do. The only difference is that they do not have language or words that we understand, with which they might express their suffering. \n\ Watch the following video by [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIP5Yrqdugc&feature=youtu.be) to understand how animals feel pain better.\n\ [Livekindly](https://www.livekindly.co/animals-feel-pain/) has done some work in understanding the scientific literature associated with how animals feel pain.
